What is Playwright?

Playwright is an open-source tool by Microsoft for automating web browser testing.
Playwright is a framework for automating web browsers, enabling end-to-end testing. 
Beyond browser automation, Playwright offers a dedicated API for testing and interacting with web APIs.  
Playwright is an open-source Node.js library.
Released in 2020.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment 
that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Features
----------
Cross browser: Works with Chromium (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, WebKit (Safari).
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Cross-language: You can write tests in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, or C#.


Test Mobile Web :supports mobile testing for Chrome (Android) and Safari (iOS).
API Testing: Playwright includes built-in API testing, allowing you to test backend APIs together.

Automatic Waiting(Auto-wait): Playwright waits for elements to be ready before performing actions, reducing test flakiness.

Handles Complex Elements: Easily interacts with Shadow DOM elements, which are tricky for other tools.
Parallel Execution: Supports running tests simultaneously in multiple browser instances for faster execution.

Built-in Reporters: Provides various report formats like HTML, JSON, JUnit, and more. Supports third-party reporting tools like Allure.


1) Inspector: Helps debug tests by showing click points and verifying locators in real time.
2) Code Generation(code gen): The Codegen tool records your actions and converts them into test scripts in any
supported language.
3) Tracing(Trace Viewer): Captures screenshots, records videos, retries flaky tests, and logs steps automatically.
						   Capture all the information to investigate the test failure.



JavaScript ---> Dynamically typed language

let age=30
let name="John"

age="thirty"


TypesScript --- Statically typed language

let age:number=30
let name:string="John"

age="thirty"


Why TypeScript
----------------
JavaScript (ES3,ES4,ES5,ES6)
ECMAScript - ECMAScript(ES) is the standard to which all JavaScript code must comply.


TypeScript - superset of JavaScript

A vendor such as Microsoft cannot add features to the JavaScript language without breaking ECMAScript compliance.
In contrast, with TypeScript, Microsoft can add any new features it wants, so long as the generated JavaScript is ECMAScript-compliant. 
That gives Microsoft all the freedom in the world to make TypeScript as feature-full as any other programming language.
